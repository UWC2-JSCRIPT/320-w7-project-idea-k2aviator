## Assignment Requirements

Above are the requirements for the project. For this week however, you'll need to create a plan for your project. More details are to come, but you'll need to create a pull request with the following:

* The name of your project
* An elevator pitch (a paragraph about what your project does). Be sure to address:
  * Who will use your project
  * The value that your project will provide to the end user
* [Wireframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) to help visualize what your project will look like
  * These wireframes do not have to be high-fidelity. You're free to use boxes, hand drawings, tools such as Draw.io, etc.
* A list of dependencies you'll be using for your project (npm modules, APIs, Firebase, etc.)
  * This list will likely change as you work on your project, but listing your dependencies will help you visualize the complexity of the project
* A list of tasks that need to be completed for your project
  * Example list of tasks for the Star Wars films example:
    * Setup `create-react-app` scaffold
    * Call the Star Wars API and print results
    * Store API results in React component state
    * Render React state
* A plan for the next 3 weeks and what you plan to accomplish each week
